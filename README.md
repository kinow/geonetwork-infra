# GeoNetwork Infrastructure Automation

Automation scripts for a GeoNetwork infrastructure setup. Parts of the script are based on [geoOrchestra](http://www.georchestra.org/)'s scripts. See NOTICE.txt for the licence.

## Setup

The playbook is developed and tested with Vagrant and VirtualBox, on a Linux computer. The target servers are also Linux boxes, so there is no guarantee that these scripts will work on other operating systems.
